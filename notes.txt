1. All the csv files uploaded to any script (interp, ortho_sel, visualize) have to include column labels with wavelengths 
2. If the visualization of reflectances includes a first bright square and the rest are dark, the algorithm counts the first row (labels of wavelength) as actual data 


Questions: 
- Does it make sense that some of the determinants for selected vectors are zero (MacBeth)? 

TO DO: 
- Send a CSV of RGBs to Derya 
- Ortho_sel: save an output file with file name and ortho defect 
- Visualize.py: allow to visualize all the csv files in a specified folder 
- Visualize the selected rows from MacBeth 
- Write the spctral sensitivity reconstruction script (decide on the structure of the script)
