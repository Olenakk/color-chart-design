1. All the csv files uploaded to any script (interp, ortho_sel, visualize) have to include column labels with wavelengths 
2. If the visualization of reflectances includes a first bright square and the rest are dark, the algorithm counts the first row (labels of wavelength) as actual data 


Notes: 
- Visualization has blueish colors 

TO DO: 

- Debug color selection (selects very similar colors)
- Test the orthogonality defect script -Done  MAKE SURE I CAN USE ABSOLUTE VALUE FOR THE DETERMINANT 
- Write the spctral sensitivity reconstruction script (decide on the structure of the script)
